## 🛠 Setup

Ready to dive into the code and see how it all works? Here's how to get it running locally.

### 1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elliottbarnes/my-website.git
cd my-website
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

This project relies on GSAP for animations (already included in `index.html` via CDN). No additional dependencies are required.

### 3. Customize:

Update the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `scripts.js` files with your own content, projects, and animations.

### 4. Deploy on AWS S3:

I deployed the site using S3 and Route 53. Here’s a quick guide to get started with your own AWS setup:

	1.	Upload the files to an S3 bucket.
	2.	Configure S3 static website hosting in your bucket settings.
	3.	Link your custom domain using Route 53 for DNS management.
	4.	Ensure HTTPS with a free SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (for security 🔒).
